This folder contains the scripts for reproducing the analysis of "Distinguishing cophylogenetic signal from phylogenetic congruence clarifies the interplay between evolutionary history and species interactions" by Benoît Perez-Lamarque and Hélène Morlon.


It contains 3 files:
- "script_cophylogenetic_signal.R": the script to reproduce the simulations, run global-fit approaches, and plot the figures
- "functions_parafit_paco.R": ParaFit and PACo functions that implement the  "null model 2"  (see https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16681 for more details)
- "script_run_eMPRess.sh": the script for automatically running eMPRess with the command line on our simulations.
